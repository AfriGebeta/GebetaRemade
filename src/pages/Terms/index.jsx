                <p className="mt-[1%]">
                You agree to pay all fees owed for your use of the Services, as calculated by our records and based on (i) our publicly available pricing, currently located at www.mapbox.com/pricing, if you use the Services directly through our site or (ii) the pricing included in the listing information accompanying the Services offered via a Marketplace if you transact for use of the Services through such Marketplace. All charges are non-refundable unless expressly prohibited by applicable law. We or a third-party acting on our behalf or pursuant to our instructions (“Payment Partner”) may invoice and charge you on a recurring basis for any amounts that you owe us, some of which may require advance payments.

                Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by us in collecting such delinquent amounts.

                <p className="mt-[1%]">
                We are not responsible for any bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, over draft charges, or other fees resulting from charges billed by Mapbox or a Payment Partner. Currency exchange settlements will be based on agreements between you and the provider of your credit card or your bank.

The payment of any taxes, charges or fees required to be deducted or withheld from payments due to us, and the filing of any information or tax returns with respect thereto, shall be your responsibility. Upon your reasonable request, we will provide you with any existing tax forms in our possession that would reduce or eliminate the amount of any such withholding or deduction for taxes.
